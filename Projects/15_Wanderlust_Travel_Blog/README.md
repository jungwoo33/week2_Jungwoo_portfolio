## 2. Description

The Wanderlust Travel Blog allows users to add and edit trips to ensure all their memories are kept in one place. On the site users can add new trips, edit existing trips, and delete trips that may not have happened or that you want to forget. Within the trips, users can also upload images for their trip and create a daily log within each of their trips.

## 3. Installation

Please make sure to have following programs installed on your computer to use this application:

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- [Git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)

To use this application, `git clone` the repo down to your local. Then, run `npm install` in order to install the dependencies as specified in the `package.json` (bcrypt, body-parser, connect-session, dotenv, express, express-handlebars, express-session, multer, mysql2, nodemon, sequelize) will be installed. Now, you are ready to go!

## 4. Usage

To use this application, follow the instruction below:

- First, run `npm install` on your terminal, then it will install the required `npm` packages.
- Second, let's create the database - `travel_db`:
  - `mysql -u root -p`: login to `MySQL` then type the following commends:
  - `source ./db/schema.sql;`: this will create `travel_db`
  - `show databases;`: Now, you will see `travel_db` in the `Database` list
  - `use travel_db;`: it is empty now.
  - `show tables`: there is no tables yet.
  - `exit`: exit the mysql terminal
- Third, let's include tables in the database we just created, `travel_db`:
  - `node ./seeds/seed.js` or `npm run seed`: these will insert the following tables in the `travel_db`:
    - `comment`
    - `daily`
    - `image`
    - `trip`
    - `user`
- Now, let's run the program:
  - Set an Environmental Variable in `./.env` file:
    - `touch .env`: this will create `./.env` file
    - Now, add the following lines in `./.env`
      - DB_NAME="travel_db"
      - DB_USER="root"
      - DB_PASSWORD="your_mysql_password"
      - DB_HOST='localhost' OR '127.0.0.1'
  - Then, run the program with one of the following approaches:
    - `node server.js` or `npm run start`: these will start `node` program in normal way.
    - `npm run nodemon`: this will start `node` program with `nodemon`, which monitors the project directory and automatically restarts your node application when it detects any changes.
  - Now, check the results in your localhost:
    - localhost:3003/
