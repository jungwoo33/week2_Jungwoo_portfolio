# README by Jungwoo Lee
## 1. Brief project introduction
I have been developing a three-dimensional ocean circulation model by combining finite difference and finite volume numerical schemes, taking advantage of the computational efficiency of the finite difference method (FDM), the exact conservation of finite volume method (FVM), and the flexibility of representing complex geometry with an orthogonal unstructured mesh system. I named my model the "General Ocean Model (GOM)", and this project is to describe some of the important features of the GOM have. 

## 2. Following the homework instructions, I have built my portfolio hompage, and the project includs:
* index.html - main page
* about_us.html - introducing why I developed my model, GOM.
* validation.html - model validation examples
* publication.html - publication with GOM
* contact.html - contact info of the developers
* reset.css - initial resetting
* style.css - main CSS file

## 3. Followings are the acceptance criteria & my application results:
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
* _This is done in "contact.html". If you click the "CONTACT" memu, you will directed to the "contact.html" and see model developer's contact information (including me, Dr. Jungwoo Lee, and the co-developer, Dr. Jun Lee)._


WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
* _If you click the "GOM VALIDATION" menu, you will directed to the "validation.html", and the page has a sub-memu bar on the top. If you click one of the sub-memu bar, the UI will scrolls to the corresponding validation test section._

WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
* _It is done in the "GOM VALIDATION" menu. I included several of my work-related equations and test results. In addition, I included the link to my publication in the "PUBLICATION" section._

WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
* _I included several of my model application results with figures._

WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
* _As I mentioned above, I included several application test results in "GOM VALIDATION" page._

WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
* _I applied the Responsive Web Design (RWD) techniques including (1) fluid layout, (2) scalable images, and (3) media queries._
